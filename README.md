# REHE
REHE: Fast Variance Components Estimation for Linear Mixed Models

Implement estimation of linear mixed model variance components via REHE, with functions written in R. Funciton inputs and outputs are made compatible with GENESIS v2.14.3.

For general use of REHE estimation, use scripts under directory R.

For reproducing simulation results and data application results in the manuscript, use scripts under directory Simulation, and data application.

For generating plots used in the manuscript, run summary_file_for_plot.R under directory plots.

Notes: R scripts under folder R/GENESIS, and R package quadprog need to be loaded before running the scripts under directory R. 

For questions of the scripts, please contact Kun Yue yuek@uw.edu. For questions of the manuscript, please contact Ali Shojaie ashojaie@uw.edu.
