# REHE
REHE: Fast Variance Components Estimation for Linear Mixed Models

Implement estimation of linear mixed model variance components via REHE, with functions written in R. Funciton inputs and outputs are made compatible with GENESIS v2.14.3.

Notes: R scripts under folder R/GENESIS, and R package quadprog need to be loaded before running the functions.
